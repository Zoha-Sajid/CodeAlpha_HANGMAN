# **Hangman Game** ðŸŽ®ðŸŽ€

## **Overview**
This is a cute and interactive **Hangman** game built using Python's **Tkinter** for the graphical user interface (GUI). The game allows players to guess a word by submitting one letter at a time. The player can also ask for hints, and the game offers three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard. The game ends when the word is guessed correctly or the player runs out of attempts. 

## **Key Features**
1. **Word Selection**: A random word is chosen from a predefined list of words.
2. **Difficulty Levels**: The user can select from three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard. Each level adjusts the number of allowed attempts:
   - **Easy**: 10 attempts
   - **Medium**: 7 attempts
   - **Hard**: 5 attempts
3. **Guessing**: Players can guess one letter at a time. If the guess is correct, the word is updated, and if it's wrong, the number of attempts decreases.
4. **Hints**: The user can ask for a hint (which reveals one letter), but it costs one attempt.
5. **Game Over**: The game ends when the player either guesses the word or runs out of attempts. 
6. **Visuals**: The game features a soft pink theme with smooth hover effects for buttons and user-friendly fonts, giving it a cute touch. ðŸ’–

## **Game Flow**
1. **Choose Difficulty**: The player selects a difficulty level (Easy, Medium, or Hard).
2. **Start Game**: The game starts, and the word is displayed as a series of underscores.
3. **Make Guesses**: The player enters guesses, and the game updates the word and the remaining attempts.
4. **End Game**: The game ends when the word is guessed correctly or when the player runs out of attempts.

   ```
3. **Clone the Repository**: If this is a GitHub repository, clone it to your local machine:
   ```bash
