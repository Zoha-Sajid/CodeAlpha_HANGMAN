"""
This is a simple Hangman game with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Tkinter. The game allows the user to guess letters in a randomly chosen word, with the goal of guessing the word within a limited number of attempts.

### Key Features:
1. **Word Selection**: The program randomly selects a word from a predefined list of words.
2. **Difficulty Levels**: The user can choose from three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard. Each level adjusts the number of attempts allowed.
3. **Guessing**: The player guesses one letter at a time. The program updates the word with the guessed letter if itâ€™s correct, and decreases the number of attempts if itâ€™s wrong.
4. **Hints**: The user can ask for a hint, which reveals one letter of the word. Hints cost one attempt.
5. **Game Over**: The game ends when the player either guesses the word or runs out of attempts. A message is displayed with the result.
6. **Visuals**: The game interface has a cute, soft pink theme with smooth hover effects for buttons and user-friendly fonts.

### Game Flow:
1. The user starts by choosing a difficulty level and clicking "Start Game."
2. The game begins, showing a word with underscores for unguessed letters.
3. The user submits guesses, and the program updates the word and the number of attempts remaining.
4. The game ends when the word is guessed or the user runs out of attempts.
